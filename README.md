# Keeper App 📝

The **Keeper App** is a simple note-taking application built with **React** and **Material UI**, allowing users to create, view, and organize short notes with a title and content — like digital sticky notes or a to-do list.

This was my **first React project**, built as part of a coding course to practice key React concepts including:

- 🧠 Managing component trees
- 🔁 Passing data via props
- 🔄 Managing state
- 🎨 Styling with Material UI components
- ⚡ Using Vite as a modern front-end build tool
